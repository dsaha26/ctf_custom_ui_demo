difference between the projects:

---
tg_test_runner

TG Test Runner has internal Test Flows
it therefore only uses singular CTF Test Action
its test_data configs are loaded at Test level
it therefore cannot tie them to Test Setup level in CTF, only Test level

NO TEST SETUP CONFIG LAYER

flow:
user picks Test Setup in CTF
user picks Test from CLI options, pick github repo, branch/tag/hash
user picks Test Data for the Test
user can edit (some of) the Test config
user can fill out the Custom UI card

---
dtf

DTF has no Test Flows
it expects a CTF Test to have multiple Test Actions
therefore its tests folder is really a test actions folder
it allows configs set at Test Setup level in CTF
it does not need Test level configs

NO TEST CONFIG LAYER

flow:
user picks Test Setup in CTF
user can edit (some of) the Test Setup config
user picks Test from CLI options, pick github repo, branch/tag/hash
user picks Test Data
